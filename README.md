## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in Starbucks Capstone Project to:

2. predict which customers will complete their Starbucks offers

## File Descriptions
There are 1 data folder which contains 3 json files and 1 Jupyter notebook available to showcase work related to this project.

* profile.json: contains data about Starbucks customer profile
* transcript.json: contains data about transaction event of Starbucks customer
* Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook to prepare data, perform analysis and build model.

## Results
Summary of the key findings:
1. 65% of customers completed the offers after viewing them
2. Females have a higher percentage of customers completing their offers compared to males
3. Older customers age 50 & above have higher likelihood to complete offers.
4. Higher-income customers with 75k annual income have higher likelihood to complete the offers
